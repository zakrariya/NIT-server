3. Let us fix this IPv6 overflow issue.
When we learn Networking we will come to understand:
- ip4 vs ipv6
- Importance of Static IP
- Troubleshooting Networking Issues

## Let us fix this issue. Type the following comands in your Virtual Machine (Black Box):

```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
```
```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
```
### Task is now complete!

# Task 2 - What is Linux Shell?

1. **The Shell (The Interface)**  
   Think of the Shell as the "outer layer" of the operating system (like a shell on a nut). It is the environment where you type your instructions.

   **Analogy:**  
   The Shell is like a chat window between you and the computer. You type something, and it waits for the computer to respond.

2. **The Interpreter (The Translator)**  
   The Interpreter is the program running inside the shell. Computers don't speak English; they speak binary (1s and 0s). The interpreter takes the human-readable words you type and translates them into a language the computer's "brain" (the kernel) understands.

   **Analogy:**  
   The Interpreter is a translator sitting between two people who speak different languages.

3. **The Command Line (The Action)**  
   The Command Line is simply the specific line of text you type to get a job done. It usually follows a simple "Verb + Object" structure.

   Example:
   ```bash
   <root@vm1>#whoami
   ```
   ## The "First Thirteen" Commands

| Command | What it does | Why it matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| `whoami` | Displays your username. | Confirms **who** is talking to the system. |
| `pwd` | **Print** Working Directory. | Tells you **where** you are in the folder system. |
| `ls` | **List** files. | Shows you **what** is inside your current folder. |
| `date` | Displays current time/date. | Simple proof that the **Interpreter** is working. |
| `clear` | Wipes the screen clean. | Essential for reducing "command line anxiety." |
| `ip a` | Displays network interfaces and IP addresses. | Helps you identify your machine on the network. |
| `hostnamectl` | Displays system hostname and operating system details. | Helps identify the machine and system information. |
| `hostnamectl set-hostname <your-hostname>` | Changes the system hostname. | Useful for naming servers and organizing systems in a network or lab. |
| `uptime` | Shows how long the system has been running. | Helps monitor system stability and workload. |
| `dnf update -y` | updates RPM repositories. | Helps to bring all your respositories and versions to current status. |
| `passwd` | Changes a user password. | Essential for account security and user management. |
| `/bin/bash` | Launches a new Bash shell (typically a non-login shell). | Useful for entering a shell environment or troubleshooting. |
| `exit` | Closes the current shell session. | Safely logs out or exits the terminal session. |
